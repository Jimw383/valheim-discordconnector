# Toggles

Filename `discordconnector-toggles.cfg`

The toggle configuration is a collection of on/off switches for all the message types and all the extra data that can be sent with them.

It's broken up into 4 sections,

- `Toggles.Messages` which turns on or off each type of message,
- `Toggles.Positions` which turns on or off sending player coordinates with messages,
- `Toggles.Stats` which turns on or off collection of individual stats.
- `Toggles.DebugMessages` which turns on or off some extra debug messaging for troubleshooting.
