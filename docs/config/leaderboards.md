# Leader Board Definitions

Filename `discordconnector-leaderBoards.cfg`

Use this file to define custom leader board messages to be sent.

Previous versions of DiscordConnector offered only a few options for leader boards, but the custom leader board configuration introduced in 2.1.0, up to 5 custom leader boards can be defined.

There is a section of this config for each  custom board that can be defined. Each is named `LeaderBoard.#`, where `#` is 1-5. By default, all the boards are disabled, so you must manually enable any you wish to use.
