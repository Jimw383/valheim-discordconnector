# Messages

Filename `discordconnector-messages.cfg`

All of the message options support having multiple messages defined in a semicolon (`;`) separated list. If you have multiple messages defined for these settings, one gets chosen at random when DiscordConnector decides to send the corresponding message.

If you wanted to have a couple different messages for when a player dies (always chosen at random), you could simply set the config value like this:

```toml
Player Death Message = %PLAYER_NAME% has died a beautiful death!;%PLAYER_NAME% went to their end with honor!;%PLAYER_NAME% died.
```

::: tip
Any of the variables in [Variable Definitions](/config/variables) from the variables config file can be referenced in any message.

## Messages.Events

::: tip
Available Predefined Variables (Events)

In the event messages, anywhere in the message you can use the string vars `%EVENT_START_MSG%` and `%EVENT_END_MSG%` (or `%EVENT_MSG%` which is uses the start message when the event starts and the end message when the event ends.) You can also use `%POS%` which will be replaced with their position if the position toggle is enabled.

| Variable            | Replaced with..                                          | Can be used in..         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `%EVENT_START_MSG%` | The event start message (e.g. "The forest is moving...") | Event start message      |
| `%EVENT_END_MSG%`   | The event stop message (e.g. "The forest rests again")   | Event stop message       |
| `%EVENT_MSG%`       | The appropriate start/end message for the event          | Event start/stop message |
:::

::: Head's Up!
If you enabled the position toggle is enabled for these messages but you do not include the `%POS%` variable, the position will be appended to the message (the default behavior before the addition of `%POS%`).
